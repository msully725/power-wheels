# Power Wheels Controller

This project is an Arduino-based controller for a Power Wheels vehicle. It includes functionality for reading throttle input, controlling motor signals, and ensuring safety checks.

The Throttle "Bins" support throttle smoothing. This prevents jerky starts and stops, saving the gears and the motors.
